# Manual Dependency Injection vs. Hilt Integration

This project demonstrates the use of manual dependency injection in the main branch and the integration of the Hilt dependency injection framework in a sub-branch. Manual dependency injection involves manually managing and providing dependencies for the application, while Hilt simplifies dependency injection by handling it automatically.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to compare manual dependency injection and Hilt-based dependency injection. It allows you to understand the differences and benefits of each approach, making it a valuable resource for learning about dependency injection in Android applications.

Explore both branches and their respective implementations to see the practical differences between manual and automatic dependency injection.
